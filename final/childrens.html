    <p>With the manga closing in on 200 volumes, the anime with 12 episodes in it's 1<sup>st</sup>season  and an incoming 2<sup>nd</sup> season this anime has won over the hearts of it's fans. Tsuredure/Tsurezure Children is a romantic comedy about multiple highschool students struggling to confess to their crushes, which I'm sure we can all relate to at one point. The anime does a great job of connecting with it's audience by relating with us. We can laugh at what they are doing but have we really done any better?  </p>
