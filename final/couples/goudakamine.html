<p>Takeru Gouda is a man only described by one word: Monotone. The entire show, his voice is just so dry and boring. Luckily, acions speak louder than words because that man can do some pretty ballsy stuff. When Ayaka Kamine confesses to him, Gouda takes a hance and agrees to go out with her. At first, he wasn't being that much of a boyfriend because they wouldn't even spend time with eachother during lunch breaks. Taking a leap of faith, our shy friend Kamine asks him to be more clingy in order to feel more loved. Gouda took it to a whole new level by doing <i>everything</i> at once from a hug to holding hands when walking and claiming her first kiss. Gouda might be a block head, but he is one determined man.</p>
