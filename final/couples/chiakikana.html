    <p> Classic childhood falling in love story. Uchimura Chiaki and Iijima Kana have been friends for a long time. They both had feelings for eachother but never had the courage to confess to eachother. Kana finally had the courage to put her feelings out for him. His response is that he also likes her. After a while, Kana started to feel a bit neglected from her boyfriend. If only he knew what was truly going on in her mind. When Kana decided to be more forward with him, she brought up that they should do more couple activities such as hold hands. Chiaki then found out that they were dating, he was oblivious! He thought that when she confessed, it was a joke. Heartbroken, Kana started to cry. Chiaki had to think quickly and mustered up the guts to tell her how he feels about her. Kana and Chiaki were finally a real couple, but even so, they still had a long way to go because even after <i>months</i> they still have yet to hold hands. Personally, I love their story the most.</p>
