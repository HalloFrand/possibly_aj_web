<p>Haruhiko Takase is the very first couple you see in the anime. Koutarou Takase calls him behind the school to confess her love for him. Takase kept his cool and waited for her even in the snow. 10 minutes of silence occurs because Takase is too flustered to actually talk. She can't get it right so she asks to meet again the next day behind the school once more. Takase starts talking to her on text instead as an alternative to being there in person. They somehow got the idea to confess at the exact same time as eachother. Takase sends a message about how he thinks people who confess over text is pretty s****y, and Kanda sent him a text confessing and apologizing about not confessing in person. The awkward silence lasted until they agreed to forget about it all. They think that it will work, but not for long.</p>
