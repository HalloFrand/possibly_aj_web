<p> Our poor friend Takurou Sugawara is constantly in the friend zone. He fell for a girl named Chizuru Takano, a very quiet and dense person. She says that she's not the type to go looking for a boyfriend, even if a boy did ask her out, she said that she wouldn't want to burden him with his denseness. Constantly, Sugawara will try to get somewhere with her by flirting a bit. It really doesn't work because as we know, everything flies over her head. It gets more and more difficult for their relationship to thrive because Sugawara starts to come to terms with the fact that she won't notice him. When he begins distance himself away from her, Takano fall ill but has no idea what her symptoms mean. Her classmates advise her that it's not a sickness and that it's love instead. They come to this conclusion after she says that her symptoms only appear when she looks at Sugawara. At the end of the school year, many of their classmates are going to the beach. Sugawara decides not to go to avoid Takano but she insisted that he came, after that, a new hope arose for Sugawara.</p>
